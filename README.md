# Context

While digging into OpenAI documentation, I noticed there was no playground for the [audio endpoints](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio). I was specifically working with the text to speech API and found it very difficult to test out the different options offered. 
I think it's extremely useful to have a UI for endpoints with audio that allow you to fidget around with the parameters.
